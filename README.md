# OLA-Project

In this project, we have given a data with 1M+ rows along with some questions. So what we did we clean the data, remove duplicates and some other changes
and then we imported this excel file into postgre sql. As there are some of the questions with the dataset so we solve the questions one by one with appropriate answer.
We add the file as OLA Project sql along with the questions with their queries.
